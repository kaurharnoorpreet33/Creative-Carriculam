        <h2>Introduction and Importance</h2>
        <p>
          Drama and puppetry encourage imagination, empathy, and communication, as they will provide children with the opportunity to experience the role and see the various sides of the coin. Dramatic play helps children to test emotions, solve problems, and build up their oral language. Recent studies emphasise the use of puppetry as one of the instruments of promoting socio-emotional and cognitive growth, especially in an inclusive learning centre (Luen, 2021). In the EYLF Outcome 5, drama helps children become effective communicators that can convey ideas using a variety of media (AGDE, 2023). It develops confidence, teamwork and narrative imagination at each early learning stage.

        <h2>Creativity Theories and Perspectives</h2>
        <p>
          Vygotsky came up with pretend play as the basis of abstract thinking that allows children to be active beyond the present moment. The theory of improvisational creativity by Sawyer considers drama as a co-constructed meaning that will be created during spontaneous dialogue and mutual imagination (Sawyer, 2023). Recent neuro-educational research indicates that puppetry and role play increase emotional regulation, empathy, and executive function (Luen, 2021). According to Turda et al. (2022), applied puppetry builds power of exploration of identity and narrative competence. These views together prove that drama and puppetry integrate social, cognitive, and emotional aspects of creativity.

      <section>
        <h2>Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          The materials used are puppets (hand, sock, stick, and shadow), scarves, hats, simple props and light boxes (shadow play). Performance space can be created in a puppet stage or in a blanket fort. Digital applications such as Toontastic, ChatterPix Kids or Puppet Pals allow children to record their voices and animate characters. The playback and peer feedback can be recorded with the help of recording devices. Scaffolding can also be extended by teachers who may ask, 'What would your puppet do next?' to prolong the creative thinking process. All the children will be able to be involved and show creativity in their original form by providing inclusive materials (Turda et al., 2022).

        <h2>Reflection and Evaluation ‚Äì Drama and Puppetry</h2>
        <p>
          Not only was the involvement high, but the drama and puppetry enactment also encouraged communication and collaboration. Children were also found to have high levels of imaginative thinking and empathy, which are in line with the conclusions that puppetry enhances socio-emotional competence and expressive communication (Luen, 2021). Digital puppetry based on Toontastic and Puppet Pals enabled children to integrate the storytelling process, technology, and performance, which contributes to EYLF Outcome 5: ‚ÄúChildren are effective communicators‚Äù (AGDE, 2023).
        </p>

        <p>
          Two things did go well, which included (1) children actively engaged in the puppet story co-creation and (2) there were more assertive participants who used language more who were quieter. These results indicate that drama is a reliable way to express yourself (Turda et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the lack of attention between the planning and performance stages sometimes interfered, and due to the insufficient puppet material, it was difficult to share.
        </p>

        <p>
          To improve a repeat of this, I would add to the planning phase by adding story cards or character cards to scaffold the story. I would also develop a puppet rotation system so that all children would have equal interactions with materials. It would be better to add group reflection with watching the recorded performances and discussing storylines with children to boost their metacognitive knowledge about creative decisions. Such improvements would enhance dramatic storytelling and intensify teamwork and further harmonise with modern views on creativity in early childhood education.
